= REDPIPE cluster POC

**POC of use REDPIPE (0.2.SNAPSHOT) in cluster using vertx cluster.
**

The scenario, 3 services:
* 2 simple services (users and club)
* 1 api gateway, that expose all other services, in the /api/xxx path

We have one single docker instance for a single service, and we publish on the service discovery the path of service.
In the vertx cluster, the service discovery is shared between the different services.

To simplify the deploy, we use a single docker machine with all dependencies inside:
it's a fat jar classpath.

How to start:
** clone the project:
**

* git clone https://github.com/fiorenzino/redpipe
* mvn clean install -Dsource.skip=true

**Clone the redpipe-cluster:
**

* git clone https://github.com/fiorenzino/redpipe-clustered
* cd redpipe-clustered
* sh docker/build_all_in_one.sh
* docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up


In the browser, you can see the service registry content:

**  http://localhost:8080/registry

* the api gateway:
** http://localhost:8080/api

To test the api gateway call:

*  clubs api:
** http://localhost:8080/api/clubs
** http://localhost:8080/api/clubs/xx

*  users api:
** http://localhost:8080/api/users
** http://localhost:8080/api/users/123456
